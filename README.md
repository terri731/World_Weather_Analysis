# World_Weather_Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of the World Weather Analysis is to create a vacation map that allows users to input minimum and maximum temperatures to find their perfect travel destination. The map includes recommended hotels and current weather data by utilizing API's. 
### Overview
I generated a list of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes. The coordinates enabled me to retrieve and compile a list of the nearest cities using the citypy module. With the OpenWeatherMap API, I was able to request the current weather data for each city. Google Map's API's enabled me to add the pins on the maps and plan the travel route to various cities.
